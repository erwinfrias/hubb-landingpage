        h2.job__title What is Hubb mission?
        p.job__description Hubb aims to solve technology addiction by bringing people together in real life. We are more connected today than ever, thanks to social media. Yet we feel more isolated than ever. On average, American consumers spend 4 hours on their phones each day, and nowhere is this trend more worrisome than in teens. Several recent studies have found a link between smartphone use and teen depression and suicide. Hubb was designed to increase the self-confidence of its users and eliminate the anxiety and social pressure of inviting friends to hang out in real life. With Hubb, our goal is simply to help our users spend more time with their friends in the real world, to increase their overall happiness.
